    <p>The Wearable Systems Lab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University develops wearable systems to explore principles of human movement and movement modification. We combine robotic, haptic, and biomechanics principles to create unique sensors, real-time models, sensor fusion algorithms, and novel feedback devices. We focus on human movement in laboratories, in clinics, and in natural environments such as a home or office. Our target applications are in medicine such as osteoarthritis and stroke and athletics such as basketball and running</p>

The Wearable Systems Lab is directed by Prof. Peter Shull and is part of the Robotics Institute and the Biomechanics and Biorobotics Lab in the School of Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
